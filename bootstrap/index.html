            <h2><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-earphone"></span> Abount Name</h2>

            <p>Our name was inspired by a poem written more than 800 years ago during the Song Dynasty. The poem
                compares
                the
                search for a retreating beauty amid chaotic glamour with the search for one's dream while confronted by
                life's
                many obstacles. "…hundreds and thousands of times, for her I searched in chaos, suddenly, I turned by
                chance, to
                where the lights were waning, and there she stood." Baidu, whose literal meaning is “hundreds of times”,
                represents a persistent search for the ideal.</p>

            <p>To best serve our customers, our sales efforts consist of direct sales teams in first tier cities and
                third-party
                distributors in lower tier cities. This allows us to better penetrate each market and tailor our support
                and
                personal interaction based on customers’ needs. Today, our online marketing platform serves hundreds of
                thousands of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and many branded multinational customers. The
                measurable
                ROI offered by our online marketing platform has made it one of the most effective marketing platforms
                for
                companies targeting the Chinese market. We will continue to strive to provide an extra level of
                value-added

                continue
                to develop and educate the many companies who don’t understand the benefits of search engine marketing
                so
                that
                we can help them grow their businesses.</p>

            <h2>About Origin</h2>

            <p>Baidu was founded in 2000 by Internet pioneer Robin Li, creator of visionary search technology Hyperlink
                Analysis, with the mission of providing people with the best way to find information and connect users
                with<img src="images/baiduoffice.jpg" class="pull-right img-thumbnail" alt="baidu office">
                services. Over the past decade we have strived to fulfill this mission by listening carefully to our
                users’
                needs and wants. To provide intelligent, relevant search results for the tens of billions of queries
                that
                are
                entered into our search platform every day, we focus on powering the best technology optimized for
                up-to-date

                local tastes and preferences. Our deep understanding of Chinese language and culture is central to our
                success
                and this kind of knowledge allows us to tailor our search technology for our users’ needs. Just to cite
                one
                example, we believe there are at least 38 ways of saying "I" in the Chinese language. It is important
                that
                we
                recognize these nuances to effectively address our users’ requests.</p>

            <h2>About Such</h2>

            <p>We provide our users with many channels to find and share information. In addition to our core web search
                product, we power many popular community-based products, such as Baidu PostBar, the world’s first and
                largest
                Chinese-language query-based searchable online community platform, Baidu Knows, the world’s largest
                Chinese-language interactive knowledge-sharing platform, and Baidu Encyclopedia, the world’s largest
                user-generated Chinese-language encyclopedia, to name but a few. Beyond these marquee products we also
                offer
                dozens of helpful vertical search-based products, such as Maps, Image Search, Video Search, News Search,
                and
                many more. We power these through our cutting-edge technology, continually innovating to enhance these
                services.
                Our new Box Computing Open Platform brings users deep-linked content and even applications they can use
                directly
                through their search box. We believe that Box Computing will dramatically improve people’s search
                experience
                and
                become ubiquitous across all Internet devices including computers and mobile platforms.</p>

            <p>In addition to serving individual users, we also serve as a media platform for online marketing
                customers.
                Our
                business model is mainly based on a performance-oriented marketing platform for businesses to cost
                effectively
                reach relevant Internet users. We offer performance-based online marketing services and display
                advertisements
                through both Baidu organic websites and our affiliated websites (our Union business). Our affiliated
                websites
                lead traffic to us through integrating a Baidu search box into their sites and/or by displaying relevant
                contextual promotional links for our customers. The majority of our revenue is derived from
                performance-based
                online marketing services and our customers pay on a cost per click basis – that is, our customers only
                pay
                when
                their paid-link is clicked through and they get the “lead”. Our goal is to give our customers an online
                marketing platform that has a wide range of functions which they can use to meet their marketing needs
                and
                an
                extensive selection of tools for managing their accounts as well as data for analyzing and optimizing
                ROI.</p>

            <p>You don’t need us to tell you that China’s Internet space is booming. With the world’s largest Internet
                user
                population – 564 million as of end of 2012 – and a long way to go to reach internet penetration levels
                of
                developed countries, China’s internet is growing in both influence and sophistication. And as more and
                more
                Chinese come online, Baidu continues to innovate to meet their increasingly diverse tastes. With our
                goal of
                best serving the needs of our users and customers with intelligent and relevant solutions, we look
                forward
                to a
                robust future.</p>
